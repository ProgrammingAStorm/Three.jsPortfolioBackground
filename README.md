# Three.jsPortfolioBackground
This project was initially intended to be the background of a scrapped portfolio website. Now its just a neat toy I made with Three.js

# Installation
To install:

- Clone the repository.
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to host the development server
- Open the localhost link your browser.

## Note!
I had a much beefier workstation when I initially developed this. Running this on my laptop was barely functional. YOUR EXPERIENCE MAY VARY
