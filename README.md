# DISCLAIMER
I decided to prioritize getting this project functional vs. getting it perfect. What is presented at the time of writing is VERY unfinished and generally unoptimized. You are welcome to play around with what few features are present but understand that its not done yet. 

Yes, "yet" as I do plan on eventually fleshing this little widget out. If I had to guess what will become of this, I'll probably convert it into a fully configurable and interactive wallpaper via [Wallpaper Engine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/), as, if I understand correctly, it runs on JS. 

IN ANY CASE please please please PLEASE, enjoy what little of this project is currently available; there is a lot love put into it. ENJOYY!! <3
